# .net core + angular universal on IIS with node server

The goal is

- Create a project with .net core + angular universal

- Running on IIS with node

Reason:

- Microsoft is going to deprecate the current dotnet + angular universal solution https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/12890

- IIS Node is deprecated https://github.com/Azure/iisnode/issues/76?fbclid=IwAR2b-sKVD8ZU2kSnQu_n5QVXTNuhcjzpSes7HbEFLU6vowi4NzD9xzsTnY4
